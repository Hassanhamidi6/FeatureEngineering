# 🔍 Feature Engineering 🚀

Welcome to the **Feature Engineering** repository! This repository contains essential techniques and Python implementations for transforming raw data into meaningful features for machine learning models. 📊✨

---

## 📌 What is Feature Engineering?
Feature Engineering is the process of transforming raw data into informative features that enhance the performance of machine learning models. It involves:
- Handling missing values 🛠️
- Encoding categorical variables 🔢
- Scaling and normalizing data 📏
- Creating interaction features ⚡
- Dimensionality reduction 🎭
- And much more! 🚀
